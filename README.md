Which programming language and version did you pick?
  Java
Why did you pick this programming language?
  It inherently supports object-oriented programming, which is ideal for managing complex systems and maintaining scalable projects.
How your programming language chosen handles: object-oriented programming, file ingestion, conditional statements, assignment statements, loops, subprograms (functions/methods), unit testing and exception handling. If one or more of these are not supported by your programming language, indicate it as so.
  Java is fundamentally object-oriented, supporting encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, allowing for code reuse and modularity.
  Java can handle file operations using classes like FileReader, BufferedReader.
List out 3 libraries you used from your programming language (if applicable) and explain what they are, why you chose them and what you used them for.
  The only library used was the java standard library(JDK) for FileReader,BufferedReader,Hashmap and others
